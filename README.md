# sci-RegulatoryClusteringModel
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scircm)](https://pypi.org/project/scircm/)


## Install
Optionally create a new conda env.
```
conda create --name scircm python=3.8
conda activate scircm
```

``` 
pip install scircm
```
Note we expect python 3.8 so if things don't work first time, check you're running python 3.8 and then try again :) 

## Run
See the examples folder for a proper tutorial with data included that you can run!

#### Quick version
```
from scircm import SciRCM
# FORMAT must be csv :) 
prot_file = f'path to the output from protein differential abundence file'
rna_file = f'path to the output from differential expression analysis file'
meth_file = f'path to the output from methylation DCpG analysis file'

# Note we assume your methylation CpGs map to a single gene, if they don't see the section below.
# logFC_rna = column name in your RNA file that has your RNA logFC (same for the protein and CpG)
# padj_rna = column name in your RNA file that has your padj value (same for protein and CpG)
# NOTE: these need to be unique from one another since we merge the datasets, if they aren't, you need
# to update your csv files.
# Lastly: ensembl_gene_id this is the gene ID column, All must use the same identifier, and this must be
# labelled the same in each file, if it isn't, update your column names before running.

rcm = SciRCM(meth_file, rna_file, prot_file, 
             "logFC_rna", "padj_rna", "CpG_Beta_diff", "padj_meth", "logFC_protein", "padj_protein",
             "ensembl_gene_id", sep=',',
             rna_padj_cutoff=0.05, 
             prot_padj_cutoff=0.05, 
             meth_padj_cutoff=0.05,
             rna_logfc_cutoff=1.0, 
             prot_logfc_cutoff=0.5, 
             meth_diff_cutoff=0.1, 
             output_dir='',
             non_coding_genes=['None'],
             output_filename='RCM_Output.csv',
             bg_type = '(P&M)|(P&R)|(M&R)'
         )
rcm.run()
df = rcm.get_df()
# That DF now has your rcm clustering results, how easy was that :D
```
#### Making your CpGs map to a single gene version
```
from scircm import filter_methylation_data_by_genes
meth_df = pd.read_csv(f'path to the output from methylation DCpG analysis file')
# Note: you need to pass it: 
# 1) the gene ID column, here it is 'ensembl_gene_id'
# 2) the padj column: here it is 'padj_meth'
# 3) the logFC or test statistic column: here it is 'CpG_Beta_diff'
filtered_meth_df = filter_methylation_data_by_genes(meth_df, 'ensembl_gene_id', 'padj_meth', 'CpG_Beta_diff')
```
Now you can run the first version :) 


#### R version

If you don't have conda, you'll need to do the below, first make sure you have reticulate installed. 
```
install.packages('reticulate')
```
Create a new environment and install scircm.
```
virtualenv_create(
      envname = "ml",
      python = NULL,
      packages = "scircm",
      system_site_packages = getOption("reticulate.virtualenv.system_site_packages",
                                       default = FALSE)
    )
```
Then run the following script!

```
library(tidyverse) # install these if you don't have them
library(dplyr)
library(reticulate)

# If things fail here it's because you need to the steps above
use_condaenv("ml", required = TRUE) # OR use_virtualenv("ml", required = TRUE)  # depending on how you installed it!
scircm <<- import("scircm")    # Make global

prot_file <- 'path to the output from protein differential abundence file'
rna_file <- 'path to the output from differential expression analysis file'
meth_file <- 'path to the output from methylation DCpG analysis file'

rcm = scircm$SciRCM(meth_file, rna_file, prot_file, 
             "logFC_rna", "padj_rna", "CpG_Beta_diff", "padj_meth", "logFC_protein", "padj_protein",
             "ensembl_gene_id", sep=',',
             rna_padj_cutoff=0.05, 
             prot_padj_cutoff=0.05, 
             meth_padj_cutoff=0.05,
             rna_logfc_cutoff=1.0, 
             prot_logfc_cutoff=0.5, 
             meth_diff_cutoff=0.1, 
             output_dir='',
             non_coding_genes=['None'],
             output_filename='RCM_Output.csv',
             bg_type = '(P&M)|(P&R)|(M&R)'
         )
rcm$run()
df <- rcm$get_df()
```

## Regulatory clustering model

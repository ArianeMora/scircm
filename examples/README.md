# Tutorials

Here we will update tutorials as we develop more. At the moment I have COVID and it is the weekend so only going to make 
one in time for our pre-print to be released (then go do some painting and make some soup).  

This tutorial runs through the SiRCle clustering on patients that we have already performed differential analysis on.
We won't be releasing tutorials on these steps as you can go to one of the many already great tutorials in R on how
 to find DEGs in R, etc.  

We also show a very simple example on how to run the comparison on two patient groups.

Lastly, this is the list of tutorials we're planning on releasing:  

1. Tutorial 1 but in R (our R package just needs some more testing)  
2. More in depth/figures to do QC on your results   
3. Some VAE fun (this will be a deep dive into the VAE component)  

Keep in mind **(2)** is actually already available via: https://github.com/ArianeMora/SiRCle_multiomics_integration as we 
go through plenty of QC for our paper, see all the notebooks in the manuscript_reproducibility folder from that github.
**(3)** I'll mainly be doing anyway as part of my thesis so figure I'd share the fun bits.   

If anyone wants some specific tutorials, feel free to post an issue on the github with 
your requests and we'll see what we can do, also if you notice any bugs in the code please do let us know :) 
Also very happy to take suggestions for improvements!
